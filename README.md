# KvantumBlog
Blogging system using Kvantum. Entries are read from markdown files in `kvantum/entries/`. The first
line in every markdown file is reserved for the blog entry title. The system listens to file changes
so the entry will be updated as soon as you save your file.

## TODO:
* Add a favicon
* Make it a bit prettier, perhaps
